mod_layout install
--------------------------------------
Do you use DSO? If so just type make and
as long as apxs is in your path all things
should go smoothly.
If you are not using DSO you should be :)

If for some reason you need to compile
apache try the following:
1. Copy the contents of mod_layout into a directory under
   your treee so that you have:
   src/modules/layout/ 

2. Now copy the file Makefile.STATIC to Makefile in the 
   layout directory.

3. Call the configure script as you normally would and add the switch:
   --enable-module=src/modules/layout/liblayout.a


4. Make sure the build environment is clean by issuing the following
   command:
> make clean

5. Build the new httpd binary with:
> make

6. Install the new httpd binary with:
> make install

7. Restart apache. Make sure you do a:
> apachectl stop 
> apachectl start 


See the README file for more on how to configure
mod_layout.
